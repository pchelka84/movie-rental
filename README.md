# Movie rentals

This project was build as a practice project of an online course [Mastering React](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react).

This simple one page app displays a table of movies available to rent. A delete button allows delete a corresponding movie. A paragraph on th top displays information with number of movies available for rent.
